--Analysis for my project--

I am creating an online version of Love Letters for my friend Douglas Tennant. It is being designed so he can play love letters with others online or by himself.

Specifications:
The program must have a way to specify how many players will be playing (2 - 4) and whether the opponents are player connected from another computer or if they are a computer opponent.
The computer based opponents must have a difficulty setting to make it easier or harder for the players to beat. The hardest opponents should be able to predict what cards other players have and the easiest opponent should make small errors and be more erratic.
The cards must all have a value and an ability that happens when it is played and any other ability that is triggered by the card.
Players must have a name and an in/out state, a counter of how many hearts they have won and a current card (that can only be seen by them and actions that involve the cards role)
The system must be friendly to all users, supplying short descriptions of what every button does, and providing a tutorial. This to prevent players getting lost or having difficulty playing the game. The tutorial will guide new players so they dont have to learn from scratch, but also help returning players remember how to play.
There must be a suitable main menu containing a host and a join button, letting players create their own game with a combination of computer players or online players, or join an existing game once given an ip and port.

Overview:
Love letters is a game where multiple people compete for the heart of a princess.
The game revolves around a set of cards depicting characters found in the palace:
The Guards:
-Worth only 1 point, there are five of these cards. When played, you can accuse someone of holding a certain card and if you get it correct they are out of that round.
The priests:
-Worth 2 points, there are 2 priests. When played, you can choose one player to reveal their card to you only.
The barons:
-Worth 3 points, there are 2 barons. When played, you and another player enter a challenge - the highest ranked card wins and the loser goes out.
The handmaids:
-Worth 4 points, there are 2 handmaids. When played, you are protected until your next turn - others cant target you with their effects.
The princes:
-Princes are worth 5 points, and there are two of them in the kingdom. When played, you choose one person to duel and they must discard their card.
The king:
-The king is worth 6 points. Playing him allows you to swap cards with another person.
The countess:
-The countess is worth 7 points. The countess has no special ability once played, but must be discarded if you have both the countess and either the king or the prince.
The princess:
-Worth the most out of all the cards, the princess is worth 8 points. If you discard the princess through any means, you must go out.
Each round begins with one card removed from the pack and one card given to each of the players. A random player goes first and draws an extra card. One of the two cards must be played, often causing a special effect and the card still held is the one used in any effects that involve the player. Numerous events may end in a pleyer going out, in this case they must discard their card/cards without its effect going into effect and wont have any subsequent turns in the round. When all cards have run out, or one player is left, the values of the cards are compared and the player with the highest score wins one heart from the princess. The player may choose any amount from 1 - 10 hearts needed to win the game when the game is started and the rounds will repeat until a player has reached the needed amount of hearts.
